Camp Firewood Hangman

Instructions

Oh no! Look's like the Camp Firewood curse got hold of Gene, and it's up to you to free him! This game plays out like typical hangman: guess individual letters to spell the winning word before running out of chances. Lose all your chances and poor Gene's a gonner. All possible winning words have something to do
with camp life and the people there. You have 10 guesses. Make sure caps lock is off. Let's go save Gene!
